Mangium does not communicate with any external API apart from the updater API. If your mangium installation deems you are using it with bad intentions, that may be reported to the updater API and you may not be able to update Mangium from then on.
The updater API is only used for what was just mentioned and checking for/downloading new Mangium version from our GitHub [releases tab](https://github.com/Mangium/mangium/releases)

### What "deems bad intentions"?
If you are a business using Mangium to sell services, you will still be able to update but will disable the user account until you take action.

Of course you dont really have to abide by this but if you want to be recognised in the Mangium community, removing this feature will help you do the opposite.

 - Hosting a service that
    - is mainly for hosting/serving/exposing NSFW material.
        - If this isn't it's main purpose then this isn't necessary, but you need to tell Mangium that beforehand.
        - If the service doesn't have an 18+ age minimum then you will still not be able to update, or your account will get disabled no matter if this isn't its main purpose.
    - has racist, sexist, other discriminatory material.
